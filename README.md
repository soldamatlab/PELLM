# Protein Engineering with Large Language Models
This repository contains source code developed as part of my diploma thesis.

- The three proposed MLDE methods are implemented in `code/de`.

- The two tradintional DE benchmarks are implemented in `code/single_mutation_walk` and `code/recombine_mutation`.

- Folder `code/llm` contains code from initial exploratory experiments, which is not essential to any of the methods.

- Folder `code/plot` and `code/dimred` contain code used to generate included graphics.
