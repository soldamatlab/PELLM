To use a different Python version, set ENV["PYTHON"]="pythoncommand" and re-run Pkg.build("PyCall").



___ Installation ____________________________________________________________________________________

Conda.jl cannot be installed to its default location C:\Users\Matou≈°\.julia\conda\3\x86_64
as Miniconda does not support the installation to a directory with a space or a
non-ASCII character on Windows. The work-around is to install Miniconda to a
user-writable directory by setting the CONDA_JL_HOME environment variable. For
example on Windows:

ENV["CONDA_JL_HOME"] = raw"C:\Conda-Julia\3"
using Pkg
Pkg.build("Conda")

ENV["PYTHON"] = raw"S:\Documents\master\.venv\Scripts\python.exe"
